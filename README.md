# clear-data

Working with data in pandas should not require arcane knowledge.

 * You should not have to know the secret of
   `dict( zip( df.date, df.temperature ) )`
 * Instead, you should be able to write
   `df.date.get_function_to( df.temperature )`

More examples will be put here.  There is no release yet; this is a brand new,
experimental project.

Very early/raw source code docs are
[here](https://nathancarter.github.io/clear-data).
