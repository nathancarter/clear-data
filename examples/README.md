# Clear Data Examples

[Functions and relations](functions-and-relations.ipynb) - Thinking about the
contents of data tables in terms of functions and relations gives us new
language to describe common operations more simply.

[Subsetting dataframes](subsetting-dataframes.ipynb) - Selecting specific rows in a way that is more clear and useful than the standard methods.

(More examples coming as the API expands.  This project is just beginning.)
